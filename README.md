# Road-Traffic-Accidents
# Project Description Template
# Title:
Road Traffic Accidents Analysis Using Python and Machine Learning

# Objective:
The project aims to analyze road traffic accidents, identify patterns, and predict accident severity using machine learning models such as Decision Trees.

# Dataset:
The dataset includes information on driver demographics, vehicle types, accident causes, and time of occurrence.

# Methods:

Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas
Exploratory data analysis with Matplotlib and Seaborn
Accident severity prediction using a Decision Tree Classifier
Visualization of accident patterns by time and severity
# Results:

The Decision Tree model achieved 91.58% accuracy.
Slight injuries were the most common, with the highest prediction accuracy.
Visual insights revealed accident peaks during specific hours.
# Conclusion:
The project provides actionable insights into accident trends, helping authorities improve road safety.
